# CCTemplates
A collection of common C++ functions and data structures useful for competitive programming.  Feel free to use them for your own purposes or use the HTML code to make your own version.

Templates from my own work, adapted, or copied from https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl, https://cp-algorithms.com, https://zhtluo.com/, or https://usaco.guide/. Credit is given where it is due, but a majority of templates are my own work.

Website mostly written using Copilot and some good old copy-paste from Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GPT-4.1.
