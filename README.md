# CCTemplates
A collection of common C++ functions and data structures useful for competitive programming.  Feel free to use them for your own purposes or use the HTML code to make your own version.

Templates from my own work, https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl, and https://cp-algorithms.com

Website mostly written using AI agents and some good old copy-paste from: Claude Sonnet 3.5, GPT-4.1, and Copilot.
